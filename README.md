Coinwatch is a low-dependency python-based console client client to keep track of your crypto trades and easily let's you see if you are winning or losing.

## Usage
```bash
# Default run
coinwatch

# Specify different profile/config
coinwatch -c ~/path/to/conf.yml

# Output in text mode
coinwatch -t

# Text output wrapped in watch
watch --interval=10 'coinwatch -t'
```


## Screenshots

## Features

* Keep track of all of your trades
* Trades are grouped by each crypto currency
* Different trading profiles can be used by specifying different configuration files
* Pure text-based output is available for further processing in other tools


## Configuration
When starting `coinwatch` for the first time, it will create a default configuration file in `~/.config/coinwatch/config.yml` with no trades to watch. To get a quick overview, have a look at the [example config](example/config.yml).

The configuration file is build up like this:
```yml
trades:
  # CURRENCY_ID is found by looking up the 'id' key from
  # https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/?limit=0
  CURRENCY_ID:  # <-- [array]       Each currency will hold a list of trades
    - amount:   # <-- [float]       How many coins for that currency were bought
      price:    # <-- [float]       Price for 1 coin of that currency
      date:     # <-- [yyyy-mm-dd]  When was that bought
```
An example file could look like this:
```yml
trades:
  bitcoin:
    - amount:  5.323
      price:   10100.52
      date:    2017-12-05
    - amount:  0.001
      price:   110323.54
      date:    2018-01-27
  ethereum:
    - amount:  20
      price:   1070
      date:    2017-12-05
  # Note in this case 'iota' is defined as an empty array
  # and will not be shown in the stats.
  iota: []
```
